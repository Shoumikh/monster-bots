# monster-bots
This project is built using react js. It is made with all the basic and fundamentals of react library. 
I used class based component rather than hooks. Learned basic feaures of react through this project like
props, state, event, lifecycle methord etc.

Here I made monster cards which holds monster's name and email. User can search a monster by their name and
the page will show all the monster cards related to the input of the users.
