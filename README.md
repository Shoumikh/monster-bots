# monster-bots
Here I made monster cards which holds monster's name and email of a monster. User can search a monster card by their name 
and the page will show all the monster cards related to the input of the users.
This project has been built using react js. I used the basic feature of react library here. 
I used class based component rather than hooks. Learned props, state, event, lifecycle methord etc through this project.
